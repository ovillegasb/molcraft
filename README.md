# MolCraft

*Orlando Villegas*

Mar 2024

Python module used to manage molecular systems for molecular modeling and calculations.

It helps to configure input files, assign force fields, although it is in process it is intended to be applied with Gaussian, GROMACS and LAMMPS files. 

It will also involve molecular trajectory analysis functions. Or functions that facilitate Gaussian analysis.

`MolCraft` is a module that helps me to put together different functions and tools to manage molecular systems. It was born from my PhD thesis and has evolved over the years.

## Install
